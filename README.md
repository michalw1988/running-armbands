# Running armbands generator

With this tool you can generate your personalized running-pace armband that will help you to run a perfect race. Whether you are a pacemaker or an athlete heading for your new personal record, keeping proper pace during the race is a key to accomplishing your goal.

Set a distance youâ€™re going to run, desired time on the finish line and decide if you want to keep an even pace or use negative split strategy.

When you generate your personalized armband, you can download it on your hard drive, print and wear during the race. Good luck!
